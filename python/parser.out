expression           : 0

Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . expression
    (1) expression -> . LSB RSB

    LSB             shift and go to state 2

    expression                     shift and go to state 1

state 1

    (0) S' -> expression .



state 2

    (1) expression -> LSB . RSB

    RSB             shift and go to state 3


state 3

    (1) expression -> LSB RSB .

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (expression -> LSB RSB .)
